# StockPricePredictionClassifier
This contains applications which gather stock price information for provided companies over a provided period of time and creates moving averages for this information over a provided time window which are then used to create a CSV file for that particular stock and provided time periods. After the moving averages are generated, another application takes the CSV files created and separates them into a training and testing set. Then, the unnecessary data values are removed so only the traits pertaining to the prediction remain. Finally, a variety of different data science models are applied to the training and testing data to predict for each moving average, if the stock's price will go up or down after the selected prediction period.
